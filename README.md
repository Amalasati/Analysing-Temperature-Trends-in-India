# Analysing-Temperature-Trends-in-India

1. To study historical temperature data to identify patterns and long-term changes and use 
statistical techniques like time series analysis to understand these trends.

3. To compare temperature data between the years 1881 and 2012 and to analyze 
temperature variations across different months to detect any changes in seasonal 
patterns.

5. To create visual representations (plots) of temperature data. And to use polynomial 
biplots to visualize the relationship between temperature and the months for the year 
1881 and 2012.
   
7. To fit the temperature data to a probability distribution and calculate the return period, 
which represents the average time between temperature events of a certain magnitude.
And also estimate the likelihood of extreme temperature events happening in the future 
based on the fitted distribution.

9. To utilize time series modelling techniques to analyse historical temperature data,
identify patterns, trends, and seasonality within the data. To finally build a model that 
captures these patterns and make predictions for future temperature values.
